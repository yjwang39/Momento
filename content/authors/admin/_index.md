I am currently a doctoral student under the supervision of [Prof. Yanxu Zhang](https://as.nju.edu.cn/as_en/00/a6/c20738a327846/page.htm) at [School of Atmospheric Sciences, Nanjing University](https://as.nju.edu.cn/as_en/). I am generally interested in understanding how climate change and relevant policies would influence complex processes within Earth system, such as biogeochemical cycles of contaminants. I focus on how numerical models could help tackle these complications in geosciences. I received my bachelor's degree in June 2020 in Atmospheric Sciences from Nanjing University, where I joined the [Environmental Biogeochemistry Modeling Group](http://ebmg.online/)  and commenced modeling research to explore the impact of climate change on marine mercury (Hg) as my bachelor's thesis.
